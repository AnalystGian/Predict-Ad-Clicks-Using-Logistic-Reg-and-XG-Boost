# Predict-Ad-Clicks-Using-Logistic-Reg-and-XG-Boost

In this project, we will predict Ads clicks using logistic regression and XG-boost algorithms. I will assume that i have been hired as a consultant to a start-up that is running a targeted marketing ad campaign on Facebook. The company wants to analyze customer behavior by predicting which customer clicks on the advertisement.

# Learning Objectives
1. Assess the performance of trained classifier models using various KPIs such as accuracy, precision and recall
2. Perform data cleaning, feature engineering and visualization
3. Train and test an XG-Boost and Logistic Regression models in Scikit-Learn

# PROJECT STRUCTURE
This project is divided into different tasks:

TASK 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM STATEMENT

TASK 2: IMPORT LIBRARIES AND DATASETS

TASK 3: EXPLORE DATASET

TASK 4: PERFORM DATA VISUALIZATION

TASK 5: PREPARE THE DATA FOR TRAINING

TASK 6: PERFORM MODEL TRAINING

TASK 7: TEST TRAINED MODEL

TASK 8: VISUALIZE TRAINING/TESTING DATASETS AND TRAINED MODEL
